**********INSTRUCTIONS***********


Create saliency_maps folder for any new set of images

Add different saliency maps folders into saliency_maps folder

Ensure that saliency maps have same name as the images and are .png files  

[The data setup should be like women category in the data folder. YOu can add any number of saliency folders in the saliency_maps folders]

Run co_fuse_demo.m for algorithm
