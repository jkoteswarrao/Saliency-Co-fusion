# Saliency-Co-fusion Code in this repository is slightly modified implimentation of the paper titled "Image Co-segmentation via Saliency Co-fusion" for distribution purposes.


"

**********INSTRUCTIONS***********
Run compile.m
Run demo.m

The outputs can be seen in the created sub-folders of the folders containing the images. For example, see ./data/women/    . 

If you want to perform saliency co-fusion with more saliency maps, update saliencydetection.m accordingly.

NOTE: Ensure that saliency maps have same name as the image and are .png files. Path of the dataset (such as our data folder) should be as small as possible. It is recommended that you extract saliency_co-fusion.zip immediate to the drive (for e.g. E:/saliency_co-fusion/)
